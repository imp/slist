 Fixes and new features compared to iSCSI target distributed with OpenSolaris
 ============================================================================

Version 16

o Fix unintialized pointer dereference in msg_lu_capacity_change handling


Version 15

o Message "Underflow occurred" is ifdef'ed out as it is not an error
  condition, but rather an informational message.


Version 14

o By default emit errors (messages tagged with level Q_*_ERRS) to
  the syslog facility. When qlog-lvl is set to non-zero value
  it overrides the default mask and takes precedence.


Version 13

o When issuing "iscsitadm create target -x ..." do not skip backing storage
  link creation, but ony bypass its validation.


Version 12

o Enable changing the internal logging faciltiy at runtime via
  iscsitadm modify variable varname=value


Version 11

o Make ALUA support compilation-time feature (ENABLE_ALUA).


Version 10

o Remove hardware accelerated CRC32 calculation. There are situation
  when it produces wrong results.

 
Version 9

o Provide option (-X/--replace-lun) to replace existing LU with the new one
  when calling "iscsitadm create target"


Version 8

o Allow setting the iSCSI target name (-n/--iqn) instead of generating
  default iqn.1986-03.com.sun:02:<UUID>
o Allow setting CHAP secrets from command line, rather than entering them
  interactively
o Provide option (-x/--skip-bs-validation) that disables all the backing
  store checks during the target creation


Version 7

o Allow setting maxrecv, TPGT and ACL during target creation
o Fix issue with incorrect PRODUCT ID initialization when no GUID is set


Version 6

o Allow setting many additional SCSI parameters during LU creation
        SCSI Vendor ID (-V)
        SCSI Product ID (-O)
        SCSI3 GUID (-G)
        Disk geometry - CHS (-c, -h, -k)
        Disk RPM (-M)
        Disk BPS (-B)
        Disk interleave (-L)


Version 5

o fix persistent reservation problem after iscsitgtd restart

o fix persistent reservation key mismatch when loading PGR data
o fix return w/o unlocking mutex in spc_pr_out_register()
  when checking for reservation conflict


Version 4

o Allow changing LU capacity (size) even in case the backing store is not a
  regular file (i.e. a block device)


Version 3

o fix persistent reservation problem after iscsitgtd restart


Version 2

o option to set reported iSNS entity nodename
  iscsitadm modify admin -e nodename

o fix issue with iSNS connection not being established due to async connect()
  erroneously returning -1  (errno == 0)
